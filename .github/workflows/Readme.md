This folder contains a typical file that defines a workflow.


By default we just call the centralized builder proposed by the bookbuilderdashboard project.


```
name: Book with Pillar

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 0 * * 0'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    uses: SquareBracketAssociates/BookBuilderDashboard/.github/workflows/main.yml@newVersionOfPillar
    with:
      bookname: MyBook

```


The centralized builder logic is around the following logic that we give here as documentation

```
on: 
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      bookname:
        description: 'Filename of the book to be built (e.g. mybook)'
        required: true
        type: string
        
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      TEXLIVE_RELEASE: '2023'
    
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set PATH
        run: |
          echo "${{ github.workspace }}/build" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      - name: Prepare Pillar
